# pizza-cloud
Pizza Cloud is a web application which is being developed with Spring Boot in Java. The book [Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-fifth-edition) is read to learn Spring Framework.
I am trying to apply the knowledge I am gaining from the book. So it is an ongoing project now.
